### Recommendations
Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations are provided:

- Investigate the exceptional growth in Q1 of 2014 and whether these are tied to seasonal or promotional factors. Understanding the drivers behind this occurrence can help replicate it in future.
- Continue to focus on the promotion of high-performing products such as Xerox 1898, Letter Size Cart, and Anker Astro Mini 3000mAh Ultra-Compact Portable Charger as these have shown strong sales and profits. Additionally, consider bundling them with lower-performing items to boost overall sales.
-  Investigate the root causes of the delays in shipping of Supplies, Labels and Storage products —whether they’re due to inventory management, supplier issues, or shipping logistics. Consider partnering with third-party logistics providers or optimizing warehouse processes to reduce delays.
- Consider incentivizing repeat customers to join the loyalty program, such as offering exclusive discounts or early access to promotions.
